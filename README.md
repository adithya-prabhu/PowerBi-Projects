# PowerBi-Projects

This is a repository of my Powerbi projects. Power BI is a business analytics service by Microsoft that enables users to visualize and share insights from their data. 
It provides a suite of tools for transforming raw data into meaningful and interactive visualizations, making it easier for businesses to analyze and understand their data.

Here, I have taken real-world datasets to create a dashboard that would help to bring the best story from the available data.
